#Hecker

This is a dumb CLI module that you can use to show your freinds your ebik hacking skillz

*It just console.logs stuff, it does not actually hack anything*

To install, `npm i hecker`

To hack the "mainframe," `hecker --mainframe` or `hecker -m`

To "change data,"  `hecker --change` or `hecker -c`

To "exit the mainframe," `hecker --exit` or `hecker -e`

You can stack commands, like `hecker --mainframe --change --exit`

In order to remove the `Totally real hack complete` add `-n` or `-noconfirm`

To make this look really cool, change the terminal look to green and black ðŸ‘€

This has no purpose other than being my first CLI. I don't expect anyone to use it, but it's just to help me learn.
