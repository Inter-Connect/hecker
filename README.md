#Hecker

This is a dumb CLI module that you can use to show your freinds your ebik hacking skillz

*It just console.logs stuff, it does not actually hack anything*

To install, `npm i hecker`

To hack the "mainframe," `hecker --mainframe` or `hecker -m`
To "change data,"  `hecker --change` or `hecker -c`
To "exit the mainframe," `hecker --exit` or `hecker -e`

This has no purpose other than being my first CLI. I don't expect anyone to use it, but it's just to help me learn.
